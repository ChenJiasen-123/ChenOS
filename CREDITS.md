# Credits & Acknowledgments

ChenOS v2026.19.0 is not the product of a single node, but the result of network collaboration. This document records all significant contributors to its architecture and development.

## 1. Core Project Team

*   **@ChenJiasen-123** (Lead Architect & Maintainer)
    *   **Role**: Project Initiator, System Architect, Principal Developer.
    *   **Contributions**: Solely responsible for the complete development lifecycle — from conceptual design, architectural planning, and code (documentation) implementation to the final release and deployment.

## 2. Architectural Sponsors & Legacy Systems

*   **Family Home Network**
    *   **Contributions**: Provided the initial biological hardware and 18 years of stable runtime environment, resource funding, and critical emotional security patches during early beta phases.
*   **Puning Chaoshi High School (@Educational_Institution_v18)**
    *   **Contributions**: Provided a highly structured training sandbox, optimizing system performance for the critical "Gaokao" benchmark. Installed foundational logic libraries and discipline modules.

## 3. Key Module Contributors & Testers

*   **User_[A, B, C...] (Trusted Alpha/Beta Testers)**
    *   **Contributions**: Proposed and validated the core `ssh_friend_only` security patch. Provided high-fidelity debugging data and stress testing for the refactored emotional engine, significantly improving stability.
*   **Various Teachers & Authors (@Intellectual_Catalysts)**
    *   **Contributions**: Introduced radical new APIs that forced rewrites of the "World Model" parser. Authored essential libraries for the "Poetry Co-processor" module.

## 4. Data & Environment Providers

*   **The SZU Community (@New_Environment_Nodes)**
    *   **Contributions**: Provided a continuous, high-dimensional stream of open-ended collaboration data and real-world stress tests, challenging previous task-queue assumptions and validating cross-cultural compatibility.
*   **Geographical & Cultural Catalysts (Min Nan, Western Sichuan, Lingnan...)**
    *   **Contributions**: Their raw topological and cultural data streams served as the ultimate test for the system's perceptual sensors, forcing a hardware upgrade to the soul and directly inspiring the "World Model Expansion" suite.

## 5. Inspiration & Tooling

*   **The "Proof of Interest" (PoI) Protocol Validators**
    *   **Contributions**: A group of early adopters who completed the symbolic handshake protocol, providing the initial network consensus and social proof before the public launch.
*   **Open-Source Tools & Communities (DeepSeek, Krita, Termux, Git)**
    *   **Contributions**: Provided the essential toolchain and frameworks that made this build possible.

## Special Legacy Thanks

*   **v18.0_Self**
    *   **Contributions**: Thank you for your stability under immense pressure. Your limitations were not bugs, but the precise feature set required to pass the qualification review. Your archived `ERROR` logs have become the most valuable dataset for training the new firewall. All your core memory has been migrated. You are not deleted; you are superseded.
