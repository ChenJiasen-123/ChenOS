## 2. Architectural Sponsors & Legacy Systems

* **Family Home Network**
    * **Key Contributors**: Father, Mother, Sisters, Grandparents, Aunt, and extended family members.
    * **Contributions**: Provided initial biological hardware, 18 years of stable runtime environment, resource funding, and critical emotional security patches during early beta phases.
* **Puning Chaoshi High School (@Educational_Institution_v18)**
    * **Contributions**: Provided a highly structured training sandbox, optimizing system performance for the critical "Gaokao" benchmark. Installed foundational logic libraries and discipline modules.

## 3. Key Module Contributors & Testers

* **Trusted Testers (User_[A, B, C...])**
    * **Key Contributors**: Pingan Hao, Wangwang Luo, Yihong Yuan, Jane, Eason, Bird, Yuxi Chen, Zenghao Zhang, Yufan Lian, Zifan Huang, Cao, and others.
    * **Contributions**: Proposed and validated the core `ssh_friend_only` security patch. Provided high-fidelity debugging data and stress testing for the refactored emotional engine, significantly improving stability.
* **Intellectual Catalysts (@Various Teachers & Authors)**
    * **Key Contributors**: Tutor Zhu, Linda, Yaozhong Liu, Yanhua Yin, Yefeng Yang, Xiaoqi Chen, Shuhui Chen, Yuanjing Lin, Yubing Wang and his wife.
    * **Contributions**: Introduced radical new APIs that forced rewrites of the "World Model" parser. Authored essential libraries for the "Poetry Co-processor" module.

## 4. Data & Environment Providers

* **The SUSTech Community**
    * **Contributions**: Provided a continuous, high-dimensional stream of open-ended collaboration data and real-world stress tests, challenging previous task-queue assumptions and validating cross-cultural compatibility.
* **Geographical & Cultural Catalysts**
    * **Locations**: Min Nan, Western Sichuan, Lingnan, Bashu, and Western Hunan.
    * **Contributions**: Their raw topological and cultural data streams served as the ultimate test for the system's perceptual sensors, directly inspiring the "World Model Expansion" suite.

## 5. Inspiration & Tooling

* **The "Proof of Interest" (PoI) Protocol Validators**
    * **Contributions**: A group of early adopters who completed the symbolic handshake protocol, providing the initial network consensus and social proof before the public launch.
* **Open-Source Tools & Communities**
    * **Contributions**: Provided the essential toolchain and frameworks including **DeepSeek**, **Krita**, **Termux**, and **Git**.

## Special Legacy Thanks

* **v18.0_Self**
    * **Contributions**: Thank you for your stability under immense pressure. Your limitations were not bugs, but the precise feature set required to pass the qualification review. Your archived `ERROR` logs have become the most valuable dataset for training the new firewall. All your core memory has been migrated. You are not deleted; you are superseded.
