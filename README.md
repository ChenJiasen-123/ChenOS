## [cite_start]I. Underlying Runtime & Data Source Migration [cite: 7]

### [cite_start]1. Core Data Link & Training Environment Upgrade [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]**v18.0:** Primarily trained on the Puning Chaoshan Real High School dataset, focusing on highly structured academic protocols[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Migrated to the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)** high-dimensional environment[cite: 10].
    * [cite_start]**Impact:** Significantly enhanced autonomous exploration, cross-domain innovation, and international protocol compatibility[cite: 10].
    * [cite_start]**Documentation:** Refer to *Southern University of Science and Technology - Shuren College*[cite: 10].

## II. [cite_start]Emotional Processing Engine Optimization [cite: 11]

### [cite_start]1. Memory Management Refactoring [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]**v18.0:** Presence of high-occupancy "unfinished business" processes causing intermittent system lag[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Achieved full release and recycling of emotional resources[cite: 14]. [cite_start]Legacy processes are gracefully terminated and archived, ensuring smooth Main Thread [0] operation[cite: 14].

### [cite_start]2. Boundary Defense System Enhancement [cite: 15]
* [cite_start]**v18.0:** Stability issues caused by specific user `User_H` repeatedly attempting unauthorized `sudo` and `root` access[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Mandatory enforcement of the **`ssh_friend_only`** protocol[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Identity is verified via public key exchange, reducing packet loss and increasing security[cite: 17].

## III. [cite_start]Core Cognition & Execution Module Upgrade [cite: 18]

### [cite_start]1. Runtime & Compiler Reconstruction [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**v18.0:** Syntax parser was restricted to examination-oriented writing frameworks with a heavy reliance on external scoring APIs[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Rewrote the compiler to support a "Restrained Language" kernel[cite: 21]. [cite_start]Supports dual-mode compilation of philosophical and poetic logic[cite: 21].

### [cite_start]2. World Model & Perception Framework Expansion [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]**v18.0:** Environment perception was limited to a single geographical node[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Deployed a cross-regional cultural sampling array[cite: 24]. [cite_start]The core database now includes datasets from Southern Fujian, the Sichuan-Western Highlands, Bashu, Lingnan, and Western Hunan[cite: 24].

### [cite_start]3. New Poetic Thinking Co-processor [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]**v18.0:** Conflicts existed between emotional units and the main logic thread[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Formally refactored as a resident co-processor integrated into the system kernel, providing metaphorical decoding and inspiration gains[cite: 28].

### [cite_start]4. Developer Mode Strengthening [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Users granted top-level architect permissions to define multi-year autonomous evolution roadmaps[cite: 31]. [cite_start]System transitioned from a task executor to a vision designer[cite: 31].

## IV. [cite_start]External Interfaces & Capability Expansion [cite: 32]

### [cite_start]1. Physical Layer Interface [cite: 33]
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Added **C1 Autonomous Driving** hardware interface, significantly increasing spatial mobility[cite: 35].

### [cite_start]2. Graphical User Interface (GUI Layer) [cite: 36]
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Integrated the **Krita GUI Framework**[cite: 38]. [cite_start]Supports non-destructive digital editing and multi-layer rendering, moving beyond physical paper-and-pen limitations[cite: 37, 38].

### [cite_start]3. Creative Output Standardization [cite: 40]
* [cite_start]**v19.0:** Poetry interfaces connected to public submission networks[cite: 42]. [cite_start]Logic outputs can now be compiled into independent `.exe` applications[cite: 42].

## [cite_start]V. Information Processing Architecture [cite: 43]

### [cite_start]1. Productivity Tool Ecosystem [cite: 44]
* [cite_start]**Input:** Lvshun (Recording), Memo (Capture)[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]**Execution:** Cheese Pie (Vocabulary), Termux (Development)[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]**Cognition:** DeepSeek, Doubao (Reasoning/Deconstruction)[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]**Scheduling:** Schedule Book, Bilibili, Chrome (Knowledge Acquisition)[cite: 46].

## VI. [cite_start]Known Issues & Future Evolution [cite: 47]

1.  [cite_start]**Resource Allocation Skew:** Excessive CPU cycles allocated to creative processes, leading to academic performance fluctuations[cite: 49].
    * [cite_start]*Direction:* Implement a "Baseline Resource Guarantee" in v19.x[cite: 49].
2.  [cite_start]**Skill Stack Generalization:** "Wide but shallow" toolset risks lack of depth in specific areas[cite: 51].
    * [cite_start]*Direction:* Project convergence strategy to focus on 2-3 core projects[cite: 51].
3.  [cite_start]**High-Dimensional Connection Latency:** Increased handshake threshold for new social connections due to strict security protocols[cite: 53].
    * [cite_start]*Direction:* Optimize identity recognition and value-matching protocols[cite: 53].

## VII. [cite_start]User Feedback (Q&A) [cite: 54]

* [cite_start]**Q: What do you listen to during walks?** [cite: 56]
    * [cite_start]**A:** A mix of poetry, psychology/CS podcasts, talk shows, and often single-track music loops[cite: 57, 58].
* [cite_start]**Q: When will you publish a book?** [cite: 59]
    * **A:** Not for at least five years. [cite_start]Writing for the purpose of publishing kills the fun[cite: 60, 62].
